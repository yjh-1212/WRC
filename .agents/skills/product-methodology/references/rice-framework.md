# RICE Scoring Framework

A method for prioritizing feature proposals by scoring them across four dimensions: Reach, Impact, Confidence, and Effort. Developed by Intercom (Sean McBride, 2016).

## The Formula

```
RICE Score = (Reach × Impact × Confidence) / Effort
```

Score is unitless — used only for relative comparison. A score of 50 is not "good"; it's better than 30 and worse than 100.

## Dimensions

### Reach — How many people does this affect?

Measured in users or customers per unit time. Be specific about the time window.

| Signal | Illustrative reach | Example |
|--------|--------------|---------|
| Affects all users | 10,000+/quarter | Login flow improvement |
| Affects a segment | 1,000–10,000/quarter | New export format for power users |
| Affects very few | 100–1,000/quarter | Admin UI improvement |
| Niche edge case | < 100/quarter | Specific error message improvement |

The values above are hypothetical and exist only to demonstrate a consistent unit. Use observed product data for the actual population and period. Don't inflate Reach by counting everyone as "affected." A feature must plausibly change their experience to count them.

### Impact — How much does it matter to the people it reaches?

A qualitative score converted to a multiplier. Use a standard scale to keep comparisons consistent.

| Score | Label | Meaning |
|-------|-------|---------|
| 3 | Massive | Transformative for the target users |
| 2 | High | Significant improvement |
| 1 | Medium | Noticeable improvement |
| 0.5 | Low | Marginal improvement |
| 0.25 | Minimal | Barely noticeable |

**Pitfall:** Impact is about the people reached, not total business value. A 0.5 impact × 10,000 reach = 5,000; a 3 impact × 100 reach = 300. The high-reach/low-impact item scores higher. This is by design — it surfaces broad improvements over narrow deep ones.

### Confidence — How sure are you about your Reach and Impact estimates?

Expressed as a percentage. Low confidence should penalize the score heavily.

| Score | Label | Meaning |
|-------|-------|---------|
| 100% | High | Direct evidence closely matches the estimate, such as production metrics or a relevant experiment |
| 80% | Medium | Credible but incomplete evidence, such as interviews, surveys, or an analogous launch |
| 50% | Low | Limited evidence or a weak analogy |

These confidence values follow Intercom's published scale, but the evidence descriptions are practical interpretations. Don't use 100% merely because the team agrees. Record the evidence behind the value, and treat low-confidence scores as a reason to learn before committing.

### Effort — How much time from the full team?

Estimate effort in one consistent unit, such as person-weeks or person-months. Include design, engineering, QA, documentation, and release work. Derive values from the team doing the work; generic size-to-duration tables create false precision.

## When to Use RICE vs Other Frameworks

| Use RICE When | Don't Use RICE When |
|--------------|---------------------|
| You have enough data to estimate four dimensions credibly | Estimates are pure guesses across the board |
| You're comparing unrelated feature proposals | All options are variations of the same thing |
| You need to defend priorities to stakeholders | The decision is a quick call between two obvious choices |
| You're planning a quarter+ roadmap | You're planning a single sprint |

## Common RICE Pitfalls

### Score inflation across the board
All scores drift up over time as teams get optimistic. **Reset periodically.** If everything scores above 100, your scale has shifted. Re-anchor against a known baseline ("last quarter's top feature was a 47 — does this really beat it by 3x?").

### Effort as a schedule, not a cost
Effort should be team-weeks, not calendar-weeks. A feature that takes 2 weeks of engineering work but 4 weeks of calendar time because of dependencies should be scored at 2 weeks. The dependency is a separate concern.

### Cherry-picking the easy dimension
If Reach is obviously high, don't pad Impact and Confidence to match. Each dimension should be estimated independently. If you find yourself adjusting Confidence to fit a desired score, you're anchoring.

### The denominator trap
Effort is the denominator, so uncertain estimates can materially change ranking. Preserve a range or run a sensitivity check rather than choosing whichever endpoint produces the preferred score.

## Example

| Item | Reach | Impact | Confidence | Effort | Score |
|------|-------|--------|------------|--------|-------|
| Add CSV export | 2,000/q | 2 (High) | 80% | 2 wks | (2000×2×0.8)/2 = 1600 |
| Dark mode | 10,000/q | 1 (Med) | 50% | 6 wks | (10000×1×0.5)/6 = 833 |
| Rebuild search | 10,000/q | 3 (Massive) | 20% | 12 wks | (10000×3×0.2)/12 = 500 |

CSV export wins despite lower Reach because high Confidence + low Effort creates a better ratio. The search rebuild has the most potential but needs validation before it's worth the bet.
